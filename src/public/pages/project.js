//This is the logic behind a project, regardless of which project it is
//this page will need to get the project id and use that to grab information from the server(?)
//and use it to populate the page

//There should be some users that are clickable, leading to that user's "profile" page
//For regular people viewing a project, there should be a button they can click that allows them to "join" the project
//That button will send the user's contact information to the project owner, who can then accept/reject the person

//For project owner, there should be a button that will allow them to mark the project as complete.
//They can record completion details and submit, which will save information and change project status to completed,
//thus removing the project from the projectBoard. It will still be visible for the project owner and the other
//contributors on their personal profiles (and/or the projectManager)
