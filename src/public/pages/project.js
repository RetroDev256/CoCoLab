//This is the logic behind a project, regardless of which project it is
//this page will need to get the project id and use that to grab information from the server(?)
//and use it to populate the page

//SHould there be one lump call to the database for everything about this project? Or should we make a little one for each thing?

//Following will need to be populated using that data:
//Project title
//User who created it, along with a link to that user's profile
//array of tags associated with this project
//Details about this project
//The deadline for this project, if there is one
//How many people are needed to help, and how many of those have already been filled
//(For regular user, should they be able to see the users associated with a project? Or should that just be up to a project owner?)
//Clicking join this project will send the current user's contact info to the owner of the project

//There should be some users that are clickable, leading to that user's "profile" page
//For regular people viewing a project, there should be a button they can click that allows them to "join" the project
//That button will send the user's contact information to the project owner, who can then accept/reject the person
