//This page will eventually be populated with stuff from project.js with additional specs for owners

//For project owner, there should be a button that will allow them to mark the project as complete.
//They can record completion details and submit, which will save information and change project status to completed,
//thus removing the project from the projectBoard. It will still be visible for the project owner and the other
//contributors on their personal profiles (and/or the projectManager)
