//This page should have details about the projects you've joined I believe? And/or the projects you've created?

//Should have projects grouped by whether they are complete or incomplete at the very least

//Clicking a project should allow you to view it in a separate tab just like clicking it from the projectBoard page

//There should a button for creating a project, which will allow you to indicate details about a new project,
// then you can submit them. That information will be used to create a new element in the project table in the database,
// so information will be sent to the server to be stored there
